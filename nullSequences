
Statements with no effect:

ARITHMETICS;
x + 0
0 + x
x - 0
x * 1
1 * x
x / 1

EXPRESSIONS:
Comparisons (ex. 5 > 2;)
Identifier (ex. x;)
Constants (ex. 5;)
Logic operations (ex. &&, ||,...)
Arithmetics(ex. 5 + 1:)
MinPrefix(ex. -x;)
PlusPrefix(ex. +x;)


LOGICAL OPERATIONS:
we will leave these expressions unaltered for the following reason:

int a = 1 && id

If we remove '1 &&', a will receive the value of id instead of a boolean value (0/1).
This could be solved by using a cast expression (bool) id but adds unnecessary complexity
